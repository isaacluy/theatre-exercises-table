# Theatre Exercises Table

## Description:

This repo contains code I quickly put together back around 2017 to create a web tool using React and Firebase that allowed me to quickly and easily sort and filter all the theatre exercises and dynamics I have learned over my 20+ years of experience as a performer based on description, source, number of people, tags and name. It's simple and it simplifies my life when I have to teach a workshop. I still use it quite often.

**Big thanks to all the projects I based mine on!**

The app is hosted on http://exercises.isaacluy.com/
(*I'm mostly putting this up as more examples of work I've done in the past*)
